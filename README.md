# 🌌 Galaxy Redshift Prediction Using CNN 🚀

## Project Overview

This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to predict the **redshift** of galaxies from their spectra and filter images. By training the model on galaxy filter data and corresponding spectra, we aim to reconstruct the galaxy spectrum and use it to predict the redshift, an important astronomical parameter that helps us understand the distance and velocity of galaxies.

### 🔑 Key Features:
- **🔄 End-to-End Workflow**: From data preprocessing to model training and redshift prediction, this project implements a complete machine learning pipeline.
- **🖼️ CNN-Based Spectrum Reconstruction**: The model uses CNN layers to reconstruct galaxy spectra from multi-filter images.
- **🌠 Redshift Prediction**: After reconstructing the spectrum, the model predicts the redshift, crucial for understanding galaxies.
- **🔄 Data Augmentation**: Techniques applied during training to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
- **📊 Comprehensive Model Evaluation**: Includes detailed loss metrics, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and graphical visualizations comparing predicted vs. true spectra.
- **🛠️ Automated Data Handling**: Scripts for downloading, cleaning, and processing large datasets of galaxy images and spectra dynamically.
- **⚡ Model Performance**: Trained for 2000 epochs, the model demonstrates strong performance in predicting redshift from reconstructed spectra.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/galaxy-redshift-prediction.git
   cd galaxy-redshift-prediction

### (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Install the project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### How to Use
Prepare the data: Ensure that your galaxy filter image files are organized in the correct folder structure as expected by the code (refer to script comments or documentation for guidance).

Train the model: Start training the model using the main.py script. This script handles data preprocessing and model training.

```bash
python main.py
```
Make Predictions: Once the model is trained, you can use the main_spec.py and main_redshift.py scripts to predict galaxy spectra and redshift, respectively.
```bash
python main_spec.py    # Predict the reconstructed spectrum of galaxies
python main_redshift.py  # Predict the redshift based on the reconstructed spectrum
```
Evaluate Results: The scripts will visualize the predicted spectra alongside the true spectra, and output metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Model Details
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to process multi-filter galaxy images and reconstruct their spectra. This reconstructed spectrum is then used to predict the galaxy's redshift, a key parameter in understanding the galaxy's movement and distance in the universe.

Convolutional Layers: The CNN uses convolutional layers to extract features from the filter images.
Fully Connected Layers: After feature extraction, fully connected layers are used to predict the redshift.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate scheduler to improve training performance.
Results
The model performs well on the training data, showing a low error rate in spectrum reconstruction and accurate redshift predictions. The results are evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), providing an overall assessment of prediction accuracy.
